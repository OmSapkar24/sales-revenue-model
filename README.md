# Sales and Revenue Forecasting

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of forecasting sales and revenue using historical data. The main methods used for forecasting include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and statistical tests to determine data stationarity.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Stationarity Check**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to check if the historical sales data is stationary. If the data is non-stationary, differencing is applied.
2. **ACF and PACF Plots**: Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots are generated to help determine the parameters for the ARIMA model.
3. **ARIMA Model**: The ARIMA model is fit to the historical data, with parameters (p, d, q) selected based on the ACF/PACF plots.
4. **Forecasting**: The trained ARIMA model is used to forecast future sales for the next 12 months.
5. **Visualization**: A plot is generated showing historical sales data alongside the predicted forecast.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `statsmodels` for ARIMA modeling
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `sklearn` for model validation and splitting data

## Usage

1. Load your historical sales data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Modify the ARIMA model's parameters based on ACF/PACF analysis.
3. Execute the notebook to generate forecasts.
4. Visualize the forecast alongside historical sales data.

## Example Code Snippet

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf

# Perform ADF test for stationarity
result = adfuller(data['sales'])
print(f'ADF Statistic: {result[0]}')
print(f'p-value: {result[1]}')

# Differencing if needed
data_diff = data['sales'].diff().dropna()

# Plot ACF and PACF
plot_acf(data_diff)
plot_pacf(data_diff)
plt.show()

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data['sales'], order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast next 12 months
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=12)
